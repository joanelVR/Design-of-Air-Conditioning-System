# Design-of-an-Air-Conditioning-System
##### This project consists in the design process of an air conditioning and mechanical ventilation system for a research laboratory. The room, an enclosed area of 100 ft x 80 ft x 12 ft in size, has 24 occupants performing light work and electrical equipment generating 28 kW of heat. The main objective was to create a thermally controlled environment capable of handling extreme summer and winter temperatures, while keeping the laboratory at a steady state of 72 F and 50% relative humidity. The improved design of the air conditioning system meets all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (O.S.H.A.) requirements in sustaining human comfort.

#####  The air conditioning system is capable of cooling, heating, cleaning and deodorizing, humidifying and dehumidifying a research laboratory per required. The design of the system addresses in greater detail cost, energy efficiency, and simple operation. The following constraints/considerations were given for this project:
 ●	No heat transfer through the walls (adiabatic process)
 ●	Laboratory is a control volume
 ●	Assume standard atmospheric pressure (No pressure drop)
 ●	Due to adiabatic process, air circulation properties are the same properties as in the room
 ●	Temperature of the moisture added is the same as the temperature of the supplied air
